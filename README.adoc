= Pitoco

Create Malli API schemas from captured requests and responses (using either https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_(file_format)[HAR] 
archives from your browser or .pcap files from tcpdump).

We use https://github.com/stathissideris/spec-provider to infer
Malli (https://github.com/metosin/malli) schemas and
https://github.com/wilkerlucio/pathom3 as our main API.

Malli has a way to generate schemas, but it was https://github.com/metosin/malli/issues/191[too slow] in comparison
with `spec-provider`.

See a quick video at https://youtu.be/iMcUTygFrfk.

== Installation

Use it directly from github for now (`lein` and `deps` should be able
to do it).

== Usage

See the test file and rich comments (`comment`) in the link:src/pitoco/core.clj[core] for usage.

We have a web app which uses Pitoco so you can visualize your
schemas easily, but you can use Pitoco as a library.

You can start the server at http://localhost:8081 by loading the
`pitoco.server` namespace. Now start the `shadow-cljs` server and access http://localhost:8000.
